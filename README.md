## JavaScript/TypeScript Coding Style Formatter

There are several configuration files used in JavaScript projects for enforcing coding style and best practices. Some of the commonly used ones include:

1. `.eslintrc` or `.eslintrc.json`: This file is used for configuring ESLint, a popular JavaScript linting tool that helps catch errors and enforce coding style rules.

2. `.prettierrc` or `.prettierrc.json`: This file is used to configure Prettier, a code formatter that helps ensure consistent code formatting.

3. `.editorconfig`: While not JavaScript-specific, this file allows you to define coding style preferences across different editors and IDEs. It can include settings for indentation style, line endings, and more.

4. `.babelrc` or `.babelrc.json`: This file is used to configure Babel, a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use next-generation JavaScript features in current environments.

5. `.stylelintrc` or `.stylelintrc.json`: This file is used to configure Stylelint, a linting tool for CSS and SCSS. While not strictly for JavaScript, it's often used alongside JS projects to enforce consistent CSS coding style.

6. `.jscsrc`: This file is a configuration file used to define coding style rules for the codebase. It stands for "JavaScript Code Style Reference". This file is typically used with tools like ESLint, JSHint, or JSCS (JavaScript Code Style) to enforce consistent coding conventions and best practices across a project.
